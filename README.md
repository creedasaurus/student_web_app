# Student Data App #

This was a node/bootstrap/js assignment that I had during my Web 2 class. I decided I should get on and store it here.

You'll want to: `npm install`
And then: `npm start`
To get the app running. 

Currently I have the node backend using MySQL, so you may have to work on getting that set up. Maybe I'll stub in some
code that'll help to keep it working even if it doesn't have MySQL to connect to.
